#Preliminary table of spiecies sequences ids in various databases and their relationship/categorization in orthologs paralogs isoforms and so on.
#  , means that the id preciding and following are identical in the Transmembrane region
#  ; means that the preciding following ids refer to the same exact sequence
#  | means that preciding ids and folling ones (even more than one) are different in the  TM region but still not clear what is what, so first choiche is what is on the left and the rest is omitted by the following analysis untill the first choiche gives problems
