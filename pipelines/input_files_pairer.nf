/*
*  This module is created for solving the issue with pairinf input files
*  it usefull in a situation where many couplesof files that have to be paired but fromFilePairs is usable
*  for example there are three files in dir1 that have the names as file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
*  and there is a correspondance with the three files in dir2 (or dir1 again) myfile1.out myfile2.out myfile3.txt
*  so file1.txt has to be processed only with myfile1.out and no th4e others 
*  same goes for file2 and 3 ecc..
*  this modules basically creates the correct input cuple for other scripts that might need that
*  WARNING  the scripts will search for an asterisc to understand ifthe input is a glob patterm
*       if it does find it will use it to obtain the keyword matcher (in the example above are the numbers)
*       that is basically the item that declares the relationship among the couples this is expected to be 
*       inside an asterisc <*> argument, so glob patterns allowed are only tose using an asterisc
